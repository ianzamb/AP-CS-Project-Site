          This is V2 of my Drawing App, now titled "Hambrano Drawing". The project now contains a "help" menu, offering a brief overview of the different app functions. Other additions include a new startup screen, an improved "Circles" button that operates at a far quicker rate than before, and varous bug fixes.

          This is my Drawing App -- a joint project with a peer. We included RGB
          sliders to change pen color, as well as polygon, star, circle,
          asterisk, and flower preset tools. The aim was to create a drawing app
          with various features/built-in designs for the user. The biggest
          challenge we faced was related to the location and drawing of these
          different designs -- the code for polygons, circles, and stars did not
          work as intended. This was because any intended pen movement commands
          were constantly overridden by another command, which forced the pen to
          always move to the cursor. In other words, the pen would always snap
          to an unintended location, rather than following the movement steps
          outlined for that specific design. After lengthy troubleshooting, we
          learned a solution -- a “pen active” variable was created, which
          starts activated, or “true.” By doing so, we essentially have the pen
          move traditionally (continuously following the cursor and pointing in
          a certain direction), though only under certain circumstances -- being
          when the pen is “active.” When the pen is not “active” (pen
          active=false), it no longer moves to the cursor, and can draw the
          desired shape in the desired location.

        <h2>Scratch Final Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1051209408/">Link</a></p>

          This was my final project for the AP Computer Science summer homework.
          In this game, the user controls a spaceship, collecting as many coins
          as possible as they fly through different parts of space. The mouse
          cursor is used to move the ship. With this project, the goal was to
          utilize all the new skills I had learned throughout the HarvardX:
          “CS50's Introduction to Programming with Scratch” course. This
          includes applications of operator, sensing, and variable blocks, among
          many others. I accomplished this goal by employing every technique
          introduced in earlier lessons. Still, it was not a straightforward
          process -- there were many challenges. The biggest one was figuring
          out how to make it appear as though the spaceship sprite was truly
          approaching the planet sprite. Since the game is only in 2D, I created
          the illusion of 3D movement by slowly enlarging the planet as the
          user’s score increases. In this final project, I learned how to
          brainstorm and create fully-fledged Scratch games with multiple
          backdrops, moving sprites, score counters, and game-over mechanisms.

        <h2>Steam Drum Boiler Model</h2>

          This 3D model was part of my Capstone Project for AP Calculus BC, a
          project that encouraged us to explore real-world applications of
          calculus. I decided to employ calculus in the context of industrial
          steam processes, such as those that might be present in an oil
          refinery. The goal of this particular model was to serve as a visual
          product for my presentation, showcasing a typical boiler for the
          aforementioned steam processes. It proved challenging, since although
          I wanted to design something in 3D, I had no prior experience with
          Fusion 360, or any CAD program for that matter. Nevertheless, I
          accomplished my goal by familiarizing myself with the program. Along
          the way, I learned various tools (shell, extrude. etc.) that I
          believed might prove useful. Overall, it was gratifying to see this
          product turn out as I had envisioned. Though some details of the
          boiler were omitted, I was generally pleased with my first Fusion 360
          effort.
